# Week 8 Day 3

#### Objective

Wireframe and logic checkpoint submission.

#### Requirements

1. Submit a wireframe that shows your app layout.
   - One page is enough.
   - Any format is fine (paper photo, drawing tool, slides, etc.).
   - We just need to be able to view it.
2. Submit a rough logic explanation.
   - Pseudocode is fine.
   - A paragraph is also fine.
   - Correctness is not graded, we just need a real attempt.
3. Submit a short progress update showing where your app is right now.

#### Submission

- App Lab share link
- Share link (or upload) for your wireframe
- Logic explanation (pseudocode or paragraph)
- Progress update (1 to 3 sentences)

#### Reflection

- What your app does for the user
- What part is working well so far
- What you plan to finish next
