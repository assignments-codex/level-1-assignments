#### Goal

Build the core interactions and start writing the real logic.

#### Steps

1. Add at least 2 onEvent handlers and test that the UI responds correctly.
2. Create at least 1 variable and update it during the app (score, lives, timer, index, etc.).
3. Create 2 named helper functions and call them from your onEvent handlers.
4. Add at least 1 if - else if - else that changes what the app does or shows.
5. Improve your wireframe based on what you have built so far (update screens, buttons, or layout if needed).
6. Make sure both screens are connected with working navigation.
