#### Goal

Plan your original App Lab project and build the project skeleton.

#### Steps

1. Pick an app idea. It can be inspired by Color Sleuth but it cannot be a direct clone.
2. Choose a simple scope you can finish this week.
3. Create a basic wireframe (one page is enough) that shows your screens and main UI parts.
4. List your screens and what each one does.
5. List your assets you will need (images, sounds, text) and gather them if needed.
6. In App Lab, create your project and build the basic UI:
   - create at least 2 screens
   - add the main buttons and labels you know you will need
7. Sketch your code plan:
   - name at least 1 variable you will use
   - write the names of 2 helper functions you will create (not onEvent callbacks)

#### Ideas (pick one or use your own)

- Color Sleuth v2: more tiles, different scoring, new difficulty
- Guess the Number: input guesses, hints, score, reset
- Reaction Timer: tap when the screen changes, track best time
- Quiz App: multiple questions, score, results screen
- Simple Habit Tracker: add a habit, mark done, show streak
