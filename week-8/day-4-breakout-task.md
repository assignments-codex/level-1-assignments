#### Goal

Finish the main features and clean up the UI and code.

#### Steps

1. Make sure the app meets all core requirements:
   - at least 2 onEvent handlers
   - at least 2 screens
   - at least 2 named helper functions (not onEvent callbacks) and they are called
   - at least 1 if - else if - else
   - at least 1 variable that changes during the app
2. Add or improve user feedback:
   - update labels clearly (score, instructions, status)
   - reset or restart works cleanly
3. Clean up the UI:
   - alignment and spacing
   - button names and labels are clear
4. If you finish early, add one small polish feature (sound, better difficulty, better instructions, best score, etc.).
