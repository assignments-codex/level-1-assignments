#### Goal

Start CSS styling and use flexbox for layout.

#### Steps

1. Create or update your CSS file and link it on every page.
2. Add a basic style for readability (font, spacing, section padding).
3. Use flexbox in at least one real section, such as:
   - header and navigation layout
   - a gallery or cards section
   - a two-column content section
4. Clean up spacing and alignment so the pages feel consistent.
