#### Goal

Start the website project in Web Lab and complete a simple plan.

#### Steps

1. Open code.org and create a new Web Lab project.
2. Choose a website topic and goal in 1 sentence.
3. Decide your 3 pages (page names and what each page will contain).
4. Create a basic wireframe (one page is enough) that shows the layout you plan to build.
5. Gather images you plan to use and add them into the project.
6. Create all HTML files and add boilerplate plus semantic layout on each page:
   - header
   - main
   - footer
7. Add placeholder headings and section labels so each page has a clear structure.
