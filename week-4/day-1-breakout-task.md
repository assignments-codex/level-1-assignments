#### Goal

Start a multi‑page site in CodeSandbox that mirrors what you built in Unit 2.

#### Steps

1. New Sandbox -> “Static”. Create `index.html`, `about.html`, `resources.html`, and `styles.css`.
2. Copy your **Lesson 17** nav into each page. Confirm links work on all pages.
3. Add at least two images with meaningful `alt`. Include a short attribution note.
4. If time remains, move shared styles into `styles.css` and link from all pages.
