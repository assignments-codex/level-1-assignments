#### Goal

Practice classes and layout in CodeSandbox.

#### Steps

1. Create at least two reusable classes (for example button and card) and apply them on at least two pages.
2. Convert your nav list to a simple Flexbox row in `styles.css`.
3. If you finish early, build a three-card row that stacks on narrow screens.
