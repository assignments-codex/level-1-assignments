#### Goal

Use Chrome DevTools and set up CodeSandbox. Rebuild a tiny page that mirrors last week’s HTML.

#### Steps

1. Open any page you made in Web Lab last week. In DevTools -> Elements, edit a heading and color to see live changes.
2. Go to codesandbox.io -> create account -> New Sandbox -> “Static” (HTML/CSS/JS).
3. Make `index.html` with `<h1>`, `<p>`, a `<ul>` (3 `<li>`), one `<a>`, and one `<img>` with `alt`.
4. Make `about.html` with a heading and paragraph. Add links so `index.html` <-> `about.html` both work.
5. If time remains, add a second image and check both links.
