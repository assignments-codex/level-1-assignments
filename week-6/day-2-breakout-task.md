#### Goal

Wrap Lesson 7 User Input and complete Lesson 8 Boolean Expressions from lecture.

#### Steps

1. Open Lesson 7 and finish the levels we started so input produces a message.
2. Open Lesson 8 and finish the levels we started so a boolean expression decides the result.
3. If you finish early, show pass or try again messages and clear inputs after a check.
