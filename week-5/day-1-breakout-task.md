#### Goal

Finish App Lab Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 we started together.

#### Steps

1. Open the App Lab unit, then Lesson 1 and Lesson 2.
2. Complete the levels we demoed in lecture so basic UI and events work.
3. If you finish early, rename control ids to readable names or add one more button event.
